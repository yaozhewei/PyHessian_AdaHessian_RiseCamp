# PyHessian_AdaHessian_RiseCamp

## Instructions
You need to install the following packages before running the jupyter notebook:
```
torch, torchvision, pytorchcv
```
Since there are demos about neural networks, we will also use GPU devices to speed up the computation. 

## Jupyter notebooks
Here are two self-contained jupter notebooks: 
```
PyHessian_Tutorial.ipynb, AdaHessian_Tutorial.ipynb
```
